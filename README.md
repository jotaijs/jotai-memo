Uee proxy memoization with useMemo to reduce re-renders.

This is not a good idea for jotai, you can create a new divided atom to solve the problem which is pretty simple.

And this violates the principle of jotai, which atom is the mean to optimize re-renders.

But the idea maybe can be used in other libraries.
